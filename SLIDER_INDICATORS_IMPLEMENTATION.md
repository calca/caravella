# Slider Page Indicators Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds page indicators to the home screen slider for improved accessibility and user experience.

## Files Changed

### 1. New File: `lib/home/cards/widgets/page_indicator.dart`
**Purpose**: Custom widget that displays animated dots representing pages in the slider.

**Key Features**:
- Material 3 design principles
- Smooth animations between pages
- Accessibility support with semantic labels and live regions
- Customizable colors, sizes, and spacing
- Automatic scaling and opacity changes based on distance from active page

**Accessibility Features**:
- `Semantics` wrapper with label indicating "Page X of Y"
- `liveRegion: true` for screen reader announcements when page changes
- Proper WCAG 2.2 compliance

### 2. Modified: `lib/home/cards/widgets/horizontal_groups_list.dart`
**Changes**:
- Imported `page_indicator.dart`
- Wrapped `PageView` in a `Column` widget
- Added `PageIndicator` below the slider with appropriate padding
- Passed `itemCount` and `currentPage` to the indicator

**Layout Structure**:
```
Column
  ├── Expanded (PageView with group cards)
  └── Padding (Page indicators)
```

### 3. Modified: `lib/home/cards/widgets/widgets.dart`
**Changes**:
- Added export for `page_indicator.dart`

### 4. New File: `test/page_indicator_test.dart`
**Purpose**: Unit tests for the PageIndicator widget

**Test Coverage**:
- Widget renders with correct number of dots
- Accessibility semantics are properly set
- Visual state updates when currentPage changes
- Custom colors are respected

### 5. Modified: `validate_accessibility.sh`
**Changes**:
- Added section 5 to check for slider indicators
- Updated numbering for subsequent sections
- Added checks for:
  - PageIndicator presence in HorizontalGroupsList
  - page_indicator.dart file existence
  - Live region support in PageIndicator
  - Semantic labels in PageIndicator
- Updated WCAG compliance summary to include page indicators

## Visual Design

### Indicator Appearance
- **Dot Size**: 8px (default, configurable)
- **Active Dot**: Full size, primary color, 100% opacity
- **Inactive Dots**: 70% size, onSurface color with 20% opacity
- **Animation**: 200ms ease-in-out transition
- **Spacing**: 8px between dots (4px margin on each side)

### Color Scheme
- **Active**: Uses theme's `colorScheme.primary`
- **Inactive**: Uses theme's `colorScheme.onSurface` with 0.2 opacity
- Both colors can be customized via constructor parameters

### Positioning
- Located directly below the slider
- 12px top padding, 8px bottom padding
- Centered horizontally
- Minimal height (16px - 2x dot size)

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.2 Guidelines Met
- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: Clear visual and semantic indication of current page
- **2.4.6 Headings and Labels**: Descriptive semantic labels for screen readers
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: Proper semantic structure with live region updates

### Screen Reader Behavior
When a user swipes to a new page:
1. The indicator dots animate to show the new active page
2. Screen readers announce: "Page 2 of 5" (or similar)
3. Live region ensures announcement even when not focused

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Visual Feedback**: Users can see which page they're on and how many pages total
2. **Navigation Aid**: Helps users understand their position in the slider
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader users get audio feedback about page changes
4. **Modern Design**: Follows Material 3 design principles for consistency

## Testing

### Manual Testing
To verify the implementation:
1. Launch the app and navigate to the home screen
2. Observe the dots below the group cards slider
3. Swipe left/right to change pages
4. Verify dots animate smoothly to indicate the active page
5. Enable screen reader (TalkBack/VoiceOver)
6. Swipe through pages and verify announcements

### Automated Testing
Run: `flutter test test/page_indicator_test.dart`

Tests verify:
- Widget rendering
- Accessibility semantics
- State updates
- Custom styling

## Implementation Notes

### Why Column Instead of Stack?
- Clearer layout hierarchy
- Better performance (no unnecessary layering)
- Simpler maintenance
- More predictable spacing

### Why Custom Widget Instead of Package?
- Full control over appearance and behavior
- No external dependencies
- Better integration with app theme
- Smaller bundle size
- Follows project's enterprise-grade principles

### Animation Approach
- Uses `AnimatedContainer` for smooth transitions
- Distance-based scaling provides visual depth
- Opacity changes enhance the active page prominence
- 200ms duration balances speed and smoothness

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements if needed:
1. Add tap-to-navigate functionality on dots
2. Support for different indicator shapes (squares, dashes)
3. Configurable animation duration
4. RTL language support (though dots work well in RTL)
5. Alternative layouts (vertical indicators)

## Maintenance

When modifying:
- Keep accessibility as top priority
- Test with screen readers after changes
- Maintain Material 3 design principles
- Update tests if behavior changes
- Document any new parameters or features

# PR Summary: Expense Group Typology Feature

## Overview
This PR implements the complete expense group typology feature as requested in issue "Tipologia di Expense Group". Users can now categorize expense groups by type (travel, personal, family, other) with automatic category suggestions.

## What's New

### 🎯 Main Feature
Users can select a typology when creating or editing an expense group. Each typology comes with:
- A distinctive icon for visual identification
- 3 context-appropriate default categories

### 📋 Available Typologies

| Type | Icon | Default Categories (IT) | Default Categories (EN) |
|------|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Viaggio / Vacanza** | ✈️ | Trasporti, Alloggio, Ristoranti | Transportation, Accommodation, Restaurants |
| **Personale** | 👤 | Shopping, Salute, Intrattenimento | Shopping, Health, Entertainment |
| **Famiglia** | 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 | Spesa, Casa, Bambini | Groceries, Home, Children |
| **Altro** | ⋯ | Varie, Utilità, Servizi | Miscellaneous, Utilities, Services |

### 🎨 User Experience
1. **During Creation**: Select a type → Categories auto-populate → Customize as needed
2. **During Editing**: Type can be changed or removed → Existing categories preserved
3. **Optional**: Groups can be created without selecting a type
4. **Smart**: Auto-population only happens when category list is empty

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
lib/data/model/
  └── expense_group_type.dart       (NEW) - Enum definition with icons and defaults
  └── expense_group.dart            (MODIFIED) - Added groupType field

lib/manager/group/
  ├── data/
  │   └── group_form_state.dart     (MODIFIED) - Added groupType state
  ├── widgets/
  │   └── group_type_selector.dart  (NEW) - UI component for type selection
  └── group_form_controller.dart    (MODIFIED) - Type selection logic

test/
  └── expense_group_type_test.dart  (NEW) - Comprehensive test coverage
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Nullable Type**: `groupType` is optional for backward compatibility
2. **Non-Destructive**: Changing type doesn't replace existing categories
3. **Smart Defaults**: Auto-population only when list is empty
4. **Proper Serialization**: JSON support with fromJson/toJson methods
5. **Sentinel Pattern**: Used in copyWith for nullable field handling

## Changes Summary

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The test suite (`expense_group_type_test.dart`) includes:
- ✅ Icon assignments for all types
- ✅ Default categories for all types
- ✅ JSON serialization (toJson)
- ✅ JSON deserialization (fromJson)
- ✅ Invalid input handling
- ✅ ExpenseGroup integration
- ✅ copyWith behavior
- ✅ Null handling

### CI/CD Note
⚠️ Flutter not available in development environment due to download restrictions. CI pipeline will verify:
- `flutter test` - All tests pass
- `flutter analyze` - No lint issues
- Build verification for all flavors

## Documentation

### User-Facing
- Feature behavior explained in code comments
- Clear UI labels in all languages

### Developer-Facing
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/EXPENSE_GROUP_TYPOLOGY.md`
- Code comments explaining key decisions
- Test suite serves as usage examples

## Future Enhancements

Ideas documented for future iterations:
1. Display type icon in home page group cards
2. Filter/sort groups by type
3. Statistics breakdown by type
4. Custom category templates
5. User-customizable defaults

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**
- Existing groups without type continue to work
- Type field is nullable and optional
- No migration required
- Old data format still readable

## Request for Review

Please review:
1. ✅ Feature completeness vs. requirements
2. ✅ Code quality and architecture fit
3. ✅ Translation accuracy (especially non-English)
4. ⚠️ CI pipeline results (when available)

## Screenshots

Note: Screenshots will be added after PR is merged and app is built, as Flutter is not available in the current development environment.

Expected UI:
- Group edit page shows type selector right after the group name field
- Each type displayed with its icon and localized name
- Selected type shows checkmark indicator
- Material 3 design consistent with rest of app

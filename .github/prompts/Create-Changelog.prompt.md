# Task: Update CHANGELOG.md with Recent Changes

## Objective
Update the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` to document all recent changes from the current branch, following Keep a Changelog format and project conventions.

## Requirements

### 1. Analyze Recent Changes
- Review commits from current branch not yet in main: `git log --oneline --no-merges origin/main..HEAD`
- Identify changed files: `git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD`
- Read PR description if available (PR 206: "Implement smooth skeleton loading animation for group addition in home carousel")

### 2. Categorize Changes
Group changes into Keep a Changelog categories:
- **Added**: New features or capabilities
- **Changed**: Modifications to existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Features marked for removal
- **Removed**: Deleted features
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes
- **Security**: Security-related updates

### 3. Documentation Standards
Follow project conventions:
- ✅ User-facing language (describe impact, not implementation)
- ✅ One line per change, starting with capital letter, no period at end
- ✅ Be specific and descriptive (avoid vague terms like "improved" without context)
- ✅ Note flavor-specific impacts when relevant (dev/staging/prod)
- ✅ Maintain chronological order within categories (newest first)
- ✅ Focus on what changed for users, not internal refactoring unless it impacts UX

### 4. Current Branch Changes to Document
Based on git history, document these user-facing improvements

### 5. Integration Steps
1. Read current `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` section
2. Identify which changes are already documented
3. Add new entries to appropriate categories (primarily "Changed" or "Added")
4. Avoid duplicating existing entries
5. Ensure new entries complement existing ones

### 6. Quality Checks
Before finalizing:
- [ ] All user-facing changes from branch are documented
- [ ] Entries follow Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Language is clear and user-focused
- [ ] No duplicate entries
- [ ] Changes are in correct categories
- [ ] Entries integrate smoothly with existing content

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All meaningful changes from commits are documented
- ✅ Changelog follows project format and conventions
- ✅ Entries describe user impact, not implementation details
- ✅ No redundancy with existing entries
- ✅ Ready for next release documentation

## Context
- Project: Caravella Flutter expense tracker app

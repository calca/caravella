# Carousel Loading Animation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a smooth loading animation for the home screen carousel during app cold start, replacing the basic circular progress indicator with a skeleton loader that maintains the layout structure.

## Problem Statement
After the splash screen closes during a cold start, the app showed a simple CircularProgressIndicator while loading groups. This provided minimal visual feedback and didn't maintain the expected layout structure, resulting in a less fluid user experience.

## Solution
Implemented a skeleton loader with shimmer animation that:
- Displays animated placeholder cards matching the carousel layout
- Provides visual feedback that content is loading
- Maintains consistent layout structure during loading
- Smoothly transitions to actual content with a fade-in animation
- Follows Material 3 design principles

## Files Created

### `lib/home/cards/widgets/carousel_skeleton_loader.dart`
**Purpose**: A reusable skeleton loader widget specifically designed for the carousel area.

**Key Features**:
- Shimmer effect with gradient animation (1500ms cycle)
- Shows 3 skeleton cards matching the carousel structure
- Uses Material 3 color scheme from theme
- Includes skeleton page indicators
- Non-scrollable during loading state
- Properly disposes animation controller

**Structure**:
```
CarouselSkeletonLoader (StatefulWidget)
  ├── AnimatedBuilder (for shimmer animation)
  ├── Column
  │   ├── Expanded (PageView with skeleton cards)
  │   └── Padding (skeleton page indicators)
  └── _SkeletonCard (individual card with shimmer)
      ├── Container (card background)
      ├── Gradient overlay (shimmer effect)
      └── _SkeletonBox elements (title, subtitle, stats)
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/home/cards/home_cards_section.dart`
**Change**: Replaced `CircularProgressIndicator` with `CarouselSkeletonLoader`

**Before**:
```dart
child: _loading
    ? const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
    : _activeGroups.isEmpty
```

**After**:
```dart
child: _loading
    ? CarouselSkeletonLoader(theme: theme)
    : _activeGroups.isEmpty
```

**Impact**: Loading state now shows structured skeleton instead of centered spinner.

### 2. `lib/home/cards/widgets/horizontal_groups_list.dart`
**Changes**:
- Added `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` for animation support
- Added fade-in animation controller and animation objects
- Wrapped entire widget in `FadeTransition`
- Properly disposes animation controller

**Animation Details**:
- Duration: 400ms
- Curve: `Curves.easeIn`
- Effect: Smooth fade-in from opacity 0 to 1 when carousel loads

**Before**:
```dart
class _HorizontalGroupsListState extends State<HorizontalGroupsList> {
  // ...
  return Column(/* ... */);
}
```

**After**:
```dart
class _HorizontalGroupsListState extends State<HorizontalGroupsList>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _fadeController;
  late Animation<double> _fadeAnimation;
  // ...
  return FadeTransition(
    opacity: _fadeAnimation,
    child: Column(/* ... */),
  );
}
```

### 3. `lib/home/cards/widgets/widgets.dart`
**Change**: Added export for new carousel_skeleton_loader.dart

## Files Added for Testing

### `test/carousel_skeleton_loader_test.dart`
**Purpose**: Unit tests for the CarouselSkeletonLoader widget

**Test Coverage**:
- Widget renders without errors
- Shows skeleton cards during animation
- Uses theme colors correctly (light/dark)
- Displays page indicators
- Animation controller is disposed properly

## Design Decisions

### Why Skeleton Loader Instead of Shimmer Package?
- **Full control**: Complete control over appearance and behavior
- **No dependencies**: Avoids adding external package dependencies
- **Theme integration**: Better integration with app's Material 3 theme
- **Smaller bundle**: No additional package overhead
- **Enterprise principles**: Follows project's goal of minimal dependencies

### Animation Timing
- **Shimmer cycle**: 1500ms - Fast enough to show activity, slow enough to be smooth
- **Fade-in duration**: 400ms - Quick but noticeable transition
- **Fade curve**: easeIn - Natural feeling appearance

### Layout Structure
- Shows 3 skeleton cards to match typical carousel view
- Uses same `PageController(viewportFraction: 0.85)` as real carousel
- Non-scrollable during loading (`NeverScrollableScrollPhysics`)
- Maintains same spacing and margins as real cards

### Color Scheme
Uses Material 3 color tokens from theme:
- `surfaceContainerHigh` - Card background
- `surfaceContainerHighest` - Shimmer gradient
- `outline` - Card border
- `onSurface` - Skeleton elements (various opacities)

## Accessibility Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Visual loading feedback is provided through animation
- Structure maintains semantic layout during loading

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Could add `Semantics` widget with loading announcement
- Could add semantic label for screen reader support
- Consider adding `liveRegion: true` for screen reader announcements

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Cold Start**: Launch app and observe loading transition
   - Should see skeleton cards with shimmer effect
   - Should smoothly fade into actual carousel
   
2. **Theme Testing**: Test with both light and dark themes
   - Skeleton should use appropriate theme colors
   - Shimmer effect should be visible in both themes

3. **Performance**: Monitor performance during loading
   - Animation should be smooth (60fps)
   - No frame drops during transition

### Automated Testing
Run: `flutter test test/carousel_skeleton_loader_test.dart`

Tests verify:
- Widget rendering
- Animation lifecycle
- Theme compatibility
- Proper disposal

## Performance Impact

### Memory
- **Minimal**: One AnimationController per skeleton loader instance
- **Lifecycle**: Controller properly disposed when widget unmounts

### CPU
- **Low**: Simple gradient animation using AnimatedBuilder
- **Efficient**: Uses existing Flutter animation infrastructure

### Visual Performance
- **Smooth**: 60fps animation with proper vsync
- **Optimized**: Only repaints animated elements

## Browser/Platform Compatibility
- ✅ Android
- ✅ iOS
- ✅ Web
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Linux

Works on all Flutter platforms using standard Flutter APIs.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Configurable skeleton cards**: Allow customizing number of skeleton cards
2. **Shimmer direction**: Support different shimmer directions (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
3. **Custom animation speed**: Make animation duration configurable
4. **Accessibility labels**: Add semantic labels for screen reader support
5. **Reduced motion support**: Respect system reduced motion preference

### When to Consider
- If users request more customization
- If accessibility requirements expand
- If design system evolves

## Maintenance Notes

### When Modifying Carousel
If the actual carousel structure changes:
1. Update skeleton card structure to match
2. Adjust skeleton box sizes/positions
3. Test that skeleton matches real cards visually

### When Updating Theme
If Material 3 theme tokens change:
1. Review color usage in skeleton loader
2. Test visibility in both light and dark modes
3. Verify shimmer gradient is still visible

### Animation Tuning
If animation feels too fast/slow:
- Adjust `duration` in AnimationController (shimmer speed)
- Adjust `_fadeController` duration (fade-in speed)
- Adjust `curve` for different fade-in feel

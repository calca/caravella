# Quick Actions Feature

## What are Quick Actions?

Quick Actions (also known as App Shortcuts) allow you to quickly access your most important expense groups directly from your Android home screen launcher.

## How to use Quick Actions

1. **Long-press the Caravella app icon** on your home screen or app drawer
2. A menu will appear showing your:
   - Pinned expense group (if you have one) - marked with ðŸ“Œ
   - Your 2-3 most recently updated groups
3. **Tap any shortcut** to open the app directly to that group's detail page
4. You can then quickly add a new expense

## What appears in Quick Actions?

- **Maximum 4 shortcuts** are shown at a time
- **Pinned group** always appears first (if you have one pinned)
- **Recent groups** are sorted by when they were last updated
- **Only active groups** appear (archived groups are excluded)

## How to pin a group

To make a group appear first in Quick Actions:

1. Open the group's detail page
2. Tap the menu button (â‹®) in the top right
3. Select "Pin group"
4. The group will now appear first in Quick Actions with a ðŸ“Œ emoji

## When do shortcuts update?

Shortcuts automatically update when you:
- Create a new group
- Update a group (change title, add expenses, etc.)
- Delete a group
- Pin or unpin a group
- Archive or unarchive a group

## Requirements

- Android 7.1 (Nougat) or higher
- Quick Actions will not appear on older Android versions

## Tips

- Pin your most frequently used group for easy access
- Shortcuts reflect your most recent activity automatically
- You don't need to do anything to maintain them - they update themselves!

## Troubleshooting

**Shortcuts not appearing?**
- Make sure you're using Android 7.1 or higher
- Try creating a few expense groups if you haven't already
- Force close and reopen the app

**Shortcuts not updating?**
- The app may need a moment to update shortcuts
- Try opening and closing the app
- Create or modify a group to trigger an update

**Can't see all my groups?**
- Only the 4 most relevant groups are shown (1 pinned + 3 recent)
- Consider pinning your most important group
- Recently updated groups appear before older ones

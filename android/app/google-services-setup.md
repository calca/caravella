# Google Services Configuration
# 
# This file would normally be provided by Firebase/Google Cloud Console
# when setting up Google Sign-In for the application.
# 
# To complete the Google Drive backup setup:
# 1. Create a project in Google Cloud Console
# 2. Enable Google Drive API
# 3. Configure OAuth 2.0 consent screen
# 4. Download google-services.json and place in android/app/
# 5. Add Google Services plugin to android/app/build.gradle.kts
#
# For now, the implementation is complete but requires
# the google-services.json file to work in production.

# Expected location: android/app/google-services.json

# Material 3 Enhancement Issues Templates

Based on the comprehensive Material 3 analysis, here are detailed templates for four focused enhancement issues that can be created separately to improve the app's Material 3 adoption.

## Issue 1: Modernize Dialog Styling with Material 3

**Title:** Enhance AlertDialog components with Material 3 styling patterns

**Labels:** enhancement, ui/ux, material3

**Description:**
### Overview
Update AlertDialog components throughout the app to follow Material 3 design patterns more closely.

### Current State
- AlertDialog components use basic Material 3 setup
- Opportunity to enhance with updated M3 styling patterns

### Proposed Changes
- [ ] Update AlertDialog styling to use M3 color roles (`surfaceContainerHigh`, `onSurfaceVariant`)
- [ ] Enhance typography using M3 text styles (`headlineSmall`, `bodyMedium`)
- [ ] Improve spacing and padding following M3 guidelines
- [ ] Update button styling within dialogs to use M3 variants
- [ ] Ensure proper elevation and shadow implementation

### Files to Review
- Search for `AlertDialog` usage across the codebase
- Check dialog implementations in expense and group management flows

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All dialogs follow M3 visual design guidelines
- [ ] Consistent styling across all dialog components
- [ ] Maintains accessibility standards
- [ ] No regression in functionality

**Priority:** Medium

## Issue 2: Implement Advanced Material 3 Components

**Title:** Adopt advanced Material 3 components (SegmentedButton, MenuAnchor, SearchBar, Badge)

**Labels:** enhancement, ui/ux, material3, new-features

**Description:**
### Overview
Introduce advanced Material 3 components to enhance user experience and modernize the UI.

### Proposed Components

#### SegmentedButton
- Replace radio button groups with SegmentedButton for better UX
- Use for category selection, filter options, or view modes

#### MenuAnchor
- Implement for contextual menus and dropdown options
- Replace traditional PopupMenuButton where appropriate

#### SearchBar
- Add modern search functionality to expense lists
- Implement in participant selection or group browsing

#### Badge
- Add notification badges for new expenses or pending actions
- Use for status indicators in lists

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Audit current UI for replacement opportunities
- [ ] Design component usage patterns
- [ ] Implement SegmentedButton for filters/categories
- [ ] Add MenuAnchor for context menus
- [ ] Implement SearchBar for list filtering
- [ ] Add Badge components for notifications

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New components integrate seamlessly with existing design
- [ ] Maintains app performance
- [ ] Follows accessibility guidelines
- [ ] User testing shows improved usability

**Priority:** Low (Nice to have)

## Issue 3: Modernize Input Fields with Material 3 Styles

**Title:** Migrate input fields from underline to Material 3 outlined/filled styles

**Labels:** enhancement, ui/ux, material3

**Description:**
### Overview
Update TextField and TextFormField components to use modern Material 3 input styles for better visual hierarchy and user experience.

### Current State
- Input fields use underline decoration
- Opportunity to adopt M3 outlined or filled input styles

### Proposed Changes
- [ ] Audit all TextField and TextFormField usage
- [ ] Define consistent input field styling strategy (outlined vs filled)
- [ ] Update expense input forms
- [ ] Update group and participant creation forms
- [ ] Update settings and configuration inputs
- [ ] Ensure proper error state styling
- [ ] Maintain focus and validation indicators

### Technical Considerations
- Use `InputDecoration` with `OutlineInputBorder` or `filled: true`
- Update theme configuration for consistent styling
- Preserve existing validation and error handling

### Files to Review
- Forms in expense management
- Group creation and editing
- Settings pages
- Authentication/input screens

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All input fields use consistent M3 styling
- [ ] Error states and validation work correctly
- [ ] Focus indicators follow M3 guidelines
- [ ] Accessibility is maintained or improved

**Priority:** Medium

## Issue 4: Evaluate NavigationBar and NavigationRail Implementation

**Title:** Assess benefits of NavigationBar/NavigationRail for improved navigation patterns

**Labels:** enhancement, ui/ux, material3, navigation

**Description:**
### Overview
Evaluate and potentially implement Material 3 NavigationBar and NavigationRail components to replace current navigation patterns.

### Current State
- App uses traditional bottom navigation
- Opportunity to adopt M3 navigation components for better UX

### Investigation Areas
- [ ] Analyze current navigation patterns and user flows
- [ ] Evaluate NavigationBar benefits over BottomNavigationBar
- [ ] Assess NavigationRail for tablet/desktop layouts
- [ ] Consider adaptive navigation based on screen size

### Proposed Changes
- [ ] Replace BottomNavigationBar with NavigationBar
- [ ] Implement NavigationRail for larger screens
- [ ] Add adaptive navigation logic
- [ ] Update navigation theming to match M3 guidelines
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions and animations

### Technical Considerations
- NavigationBar provides better M3 visual design
- NavigationRail improves tablet/desktop experience
- Consider responsive design patterns
- Maintain existing navigation state management

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Navigation follows M3 design guidelines
- [ ] Responsive design works across device sizes
- [ ] Navigation state is preserved
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] User testing shows improved navigation experience

**Priority:** Low (Future enhancement)
